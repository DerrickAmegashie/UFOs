# UFOs

## Overview of UFO’s

The project involved the use of JavaScript to build a dynamic webpage. The purpose of these pages is to accept user inputs and adjust accordingly  and also inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. The challenge involved building a table using data stored in JavaScript array. The purpose is to create filters to make the table fully dynamic meaning that it will react to user input, and place the table into an HTML for easy viewing. Further steps involved equipping the table with fully functional filters that would allow users to interact with the visualization. 

The project was to help Dana to display the data as a table. Because of so much data, sifting through will be a challenge. I was to also provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.  JavaScript has a way to manipulate the data by adding filters. Additionally, I was to help Dana put all of the information in a tidy html page. 


## Results
The results show that: 
The search criteria allows one to easily filter for information,

## Summary of UFO’s

The ability to use JavaScript to perform these analysis is an important and very necessary because it allows a table to hold and neatly display data we want to work with, also it allows us to add filters to for users to refine their searches. Finally one can have his/her data to be visually appealing and interactive. 

### Drawback
One drawback of this new design is in the search box you do not get a list of options available. For example I do not know the list of countries available that I can choose from.


### Recommendation
I recommend the filters could be made more convenient by giving options when one starts typing in the search box.

I also recommend there could be a search button at the bottom of the filter section or a search icon next to  “Filter Search”
